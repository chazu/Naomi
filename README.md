=============

**Jasper2fork project is back ! We're changing the project name to Naomi**


**Some links will may not work due to the name change, thanks to warn us**

This is the fork of the J2 fork of _thejasperproject_, thank you for all the work to this point.

Client code for the Naomi voice computing platform, an **open source** platform for developing _always-on_, _voice-controlled_ applications to bring an open assistant for **makers** and **enthusiasts**

Say hello to Naomi, an Open Virtual Intelligent Assistant, it [can do a lot for you](https://github.com/NaomiProject/Naomi/wiki/Preinstalled-and-available-plugins). We are working on creating a real working Jarvis for everyone to use everyday. If you have seen any movies like Iron Man, then you will know what we're talking about. :grin:

This fork is a work in progress and as such if you find something missing/broke/anything please make a pull request with tests would be nice, or [file an issue](https://github.com/NaomiProject/Naomi/issues).

The current plan is to use [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/knequ9t) and Github for the day to day comms.

## Installation

You can find installations steps on [the new wiki](https://github.com/NaomiProject/Naomi/wiki)

## Data policy 

We don't want to depend on having your data used saved online in order to use Naomi.

We are going to let you decide how it works. You can use online AI services or use offline AI services (on your devices). It can even use both. By using online services,your assistant has access to much more, but the service records everything you give them. Devices are getting stronger locally, let's use that to our advantage‚Ä¶ 

**Naomi is developed with :heart: and modern open source tech to benefit to all, that's why we won't collect and use your personnal data**

## Support

If you run into an issue or require technical support, please first look through the closed and open **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NaomiProject/Naomi/issues)**, as you may find a solution there (or some useful advice, at least).

If you're still having trouble, the next place to look would be the new **[Discord](https://discord.gg/knequ9t)**. If your problem remains unsolved, feel free to create a post there describing the issue, the steps you've taken to debug it, etc.
